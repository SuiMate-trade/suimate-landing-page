        These are just some basic ideas that I am planning to build on. In my
        imagination, SuiMate will one day become a platform that a user opens on
        a daily basis to get insights on what's happening in Sui DeFi space, see
        what the other people think about the DeFi protocols, the trading
        strategies of a trader, or the investment plannings, while also getting
        some new knowledge about new developments in DeFi everyday.

        Working hard to make this imagination a reality. Stay tuned! ðŸš€
